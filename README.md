# IBGE Census

Project to list the names obtained by the IBGE API.


## Description

This application uses the IBGE API to search for information about the most popular names in the Census. With this, users will be able to search and view the most common names in a given region, in addition to having access to statistical information such as the number of people registered with a given name.

The use of the IBGE API allowed us to obtain accurate and updated data to offer a complete experience to users. The application is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface, which makes it accessible to anyone.

This project is constantly evolving and we are open to suggestions and contributions. Thanks in advance to all contributors and we hope this application can be useful for all those who want to know more about Census names.
